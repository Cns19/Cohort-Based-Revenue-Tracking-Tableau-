# Cohort Based Revenue Tracking (Tableau)

**Goal:** To analyze Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) by tracking how much revenue paid users bring in over time, starting from their first payment month.

**Method and Tools:** Created a cohort analysis table in Tableau based on usersâ€™ first paid month. Used color scales to show ratios, visualized Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) for each cohort, and added filters for date and location.

**Result:** Revenue usually increased in the first months, which shows that users engaged with the product and maybe upgraded to higher plans. After the first few months, MRR started to drop. This shows a need to focus on user retention strategies. In the July 2022 cohort, revenue stayed high for the first 3 months and even grew. There was a drop after month 5, but recovery was seen in month 6. This cohort seemed more engaged with the product.

**Skills Gained:** Creating cohort structures, measuring revenue over time, analyzing user behavior with visual tools.
